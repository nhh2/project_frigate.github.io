        <p>Hi, I’m Richard. I’m a writer and an amateur badminton player.</p>
        <p>These days, I’m building Quill, content as a service. We write blogs, ebooks, and social posts that you’re proud to share with customers, and even your parents.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was a part of the YC W22 batch and founded/sold a publishing company.</p>
        <p>I have a standing open invitation for conversation (please come talk to me about anything!).<p>
