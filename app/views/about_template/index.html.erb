        <p>Hi, I’m Nick. I’m a writer and amateur programmer.</p>
        <p>These days, I’m a student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I'm exploring entrepreneurship, venture capital, and a variety of other interests. I'm also doing my best to leave time for social activities.</p>
        <p>I worked as an investor prior to business school. I focused on debt and non-control equity investments in middle-market companies.</p>
        <p>I have a standing open invitation for conversation (please come talk to me about anything!).<p>
