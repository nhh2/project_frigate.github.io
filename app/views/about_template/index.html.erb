    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Richard. Iâ€™m a writer and an amateur badminton player.</p>
    <p>These days, Iâ€™m building Quill, content as a service. We write blogs, ebooks, and social posts that youâ€™re proud to share with customers, and even your parents.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was a part of the YC W22 batch and founded/sold a publishing company.</p>
    <p>I have a standing open invitation for conversation (please come talk to me about anything!).<p>
