        <p>Hi, I’m Nick. I’m a writer and amateur programmer.</p>
        <p>These days, I’m a student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I'm exploring entrepreneurship, venture capital, and a variety of other interests. I'm also doing my best to leave time for social activities.</p>
        <p>Follow the Frigate is a personal blog where I intend to share my writings and interests. Writing is largely a personal hobby, I'm hoping to take the next step with my writing by publishing it in the public eye. I hope this blog will serve as a tool to record and refine my thinking.</p>
        <p>"Follow the Frigate" is an homage to my favorite bird. It often reminds me of where I grew up and fishing (one of my favorite things to do). More importantly, the mighty Frigate Bird is a metaphor for living life and exploring interests. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szuchBiLrEM">Here's</a> a cool video if you're interested in learning more about the Frigate Bird. It will also be the subject of my first blog post, so stay tuned!</p>
        <p>I recently purchased the domain "followfrigate.com" - I plan to make this a live, public site over the coming days.</p>
