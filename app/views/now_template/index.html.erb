        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
          <h5>Where:</h5>
            <p>Chicago! Living in the Windy City is great, except when it's windy. Thereâ€™s no shortage of things to do, friends to see, and areas to explore. My wife and I enjoy checking out new restaurants and going for long walks (when the weather allows).</p>
          <h5>School:</h5>
            <p>I'm a student at the Chicago Booth School of Business. Returning to the classroom was a bit of an adjustment, but I am enjoying it! I'm doing my best to explore my interests and passions. Learning how to code and building this blog fit into this bucket!</p> 
            <p>On the topic of blog, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge my inspiration for Follow the Frigate's layout (<a href="https://snowingpine.com/">snowingpine.com</a>). Check Richard's site out if you're interested.</p>
